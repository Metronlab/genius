# Genius

A golang generative framework that palliate the lack of generic in go.

It's for now a fork / package of https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/tree/master/tools/tmpl 
It remove support for .json comments wich is an unsafe / non ide proof way to derivate json spec.
It will add YAML support asap to give comments possibility on data feeding the generation.

cf test repository for an example.
